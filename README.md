[Project Overview](#project-overview): Unlipping PCOS: Let’s Talk About It

This project, undertaken as part of the PU5926/PU5927 Professional Placement in
Health Data Science (2024/25), focuses on leveraging health data science
methodologies to address Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The initiative, titled
"Unlipping PCOS: Let’s Talk About It," aims to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and
provide evidence-based resources for individuals affected by PCOS. PCOS is a prevalent endocrine disorder with significant implications for reproductive
health, metabolic function, and mental well-being. Despite its widespread impact,
PCOS remains underdiagnosed and undertreated, particularly among gender-diverse
and ethnically underrepresented populations. This project seeks to bridge this gap by
utilizing health data to identify disparities in PCOS diagnosis, treatment, and
outcomes, thereby informing inclusive health policies and raising awareness within
the university community.

# Project Objectives
The core objectives of this project are:
* Data Analysis : To analyze campus health data to identify patterns and disparities
in PCOS diagnosis and care across diverse student populations.
* Predictive Modeling: To develop models capable of identifying early signs of
PCOS in underrepresented groups, considering unique cultural, socioeconomic,
and health factors.
* Dashboard Development: To design interactive Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) to visualize PCOS awareness and resource availability across university
campuses.
* Reporting: To produce comprehensive reports outlining how gender identity
and ethnicity influence access to PCOS treatment in student populations.

# Methodology
The project employs a robust methodology, including:
* Data Sources: Utilizing anonymized health records, survey data, and publicly
available datasets related to PCOS.
* Analytical Tools: Employing programming languages such as Python and R,
along with GitHub for version control, to facilitate data analysis and visualization
workflows.
* Techniques: Implementing statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and
various data visualization techniques to derive actionable insights.
Ethical Considerations: Ensuring strict compliance with ethical standards,
including data privacy regulations and informed consent protocols, throughout
the project lifecycle.

# Expected Outcomes
Upon completion, this project is expected to deliver:
* Analytical Reports: Detailed reports highlighting key findings related to PCOS
disparities within the university community.
* Predictive Models: Functional models capable of identifying early signs of PCOS
in underrepresented student groups.
* Dashboards: Interactive tools for visualizing PCOS awareness and resource
distribution across campus.
* Policy Recommendations: Evidence-based suggestions for inclusive health
policies within the university setting

# Significance and Impact
This project is poised to make significant contributions by:
* Enhancing the understanding of PCOS disparities within the university
community.
* Informing the development of inclusive health policies and support systems.
* Raising awareness about PCOS among students, faculty, and staff.
* Providing practical experience in applying data science techniques to real-world
health challenges.

[Dataset](#dataset): This project utilizes the following datasets:

*   `PCOS_Survey_Dashboard.csv`: A CSV file likely containing the processed data used for the dashboard.
*   `PCOS_Survey_Dashboard.xlsx`: An Excel file, possibly an alternative format or an earlier version of the dashboard data.
*   `PCOS_Survey_Data Set_8Aug25.xlsx`: The primary dataset for PCOS, likely containing raw or pre-processed survey data. This file is crucial for understanding the source of your analysis.

[Analysis Notebooks](#analysis-notebooks): 

The following Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) document the step-by-step data analysis process:

*   `PCOS_analysis_UB_24June25.ipynb`: [Brief description of this specific analysis, e.g., initial data exploration, specific hypothesis testing, or a particular aspect of PCOS analysis.]
*   `PCOS_daatset_analysis_3.ipynb`: [Describe the focus of this analysis, e.g., statistical modeling, feature engineering, or a specific set of visualizations.]
*   `PCOS_dataset_analysis-4.ipynb`: [Explain the purpose, e.g., advanced statistical analysis, machine learning model development, or further in-depth exploration of certain variables.]
*   `PCOS_dataset_analysis_2.ipynb`: [Describe its role, e.g., data cleaning, preprocessing, or initial descriptive statistics.]
*   `PCOS_dataset_analysis_5.ipynb`: [Detail the analysis performed, e.g., time-series analysis if applicable, or comparative studies within the dataset.]
*   *   `PCOS_dataset_analysis_6.ipynb`: [Explain the final stages of analysis, e.g., result interpretation, summary of findings, or preparation for dashboard integration.]
*   `pcos_dummy_data_analysis.ipynb`: This notebook likely contains preliminary or dummy data analysis for testing purposes. [You might want to clarify its role or if it's a work-in-progress/example.]

Each notebook is designed to be run sequentially or independently, depending on its function. Please ensure all necessary libraries are installed (see [Installation](#installation) section).


[Dashboard](#dashboard): 

This section describes the interactive dashboard created using Looker Studio, which
serves as a dynamic visualization tool for the PCOS data analysis. The dashboard
provides a comprehensive overview of key findings, allowing users to explore various
aspects of PCOS prevalence, symptoms, awareness, and related factors.
# Purpose and Overview
The Looker Studio dashboard is designed to present the insights derived from the
PCOS dataset in an accessible and interactive format. It aims to:
* Visualize Key Findings: Provide clear visual representations of demographic
distributions, symptom prevalence, and correlations identified in the analysis.
* Facilitate Data Exploration: Allow users to interact with the data, filter by
different categories (e.g., age group, student status, nationality), and drill down
into specific areas of interest.
* Enhance Understanding: Make complex data patterns more understandable for
a broader audience, including researchers, healthcare professionals, and
individuals interested in PCOS.
* Support Decision-Making: Offer a quick and intuitive way to grasp the current
state of PCOS awareness and its impact, potentially informing future
interventions or policy recommendations.
# Accessing and Interacting with the Dashboard

 # Results/Findings: 
 * Summarizing Key Insights and Conclusions: 
The Jupyter notebook analyzed a dataset related to PCOS, performing data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building. Four models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy (0.5167) and F1 Score (0.4790), while the SVM model showed the highest AUC (0.5897). Overall, the models exhibited relatively low predictive performance, with accuracies ranging from approximately 43% to 51%.

* Future Work:
  To improve the analysis and model performance, the following steps are recommended:
* Enhanced Data Preprocessing: Implement more sophisticated strategies for handling missing values, such as imputation, rather than simply dropping them.
* Feature Engineering: Develop new, more informative features from the existing dataset to potentially improve model predictability.
* Advanced Model Exploration: Investigate more complex machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods that might better capture underlying patterns in the data.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the parameters of the current models to achieve their best possible performance.
* Data Expansion: Acquire additional data to increase the dataset size, which could lead to more robust and generalizable models.
* Deeper Statistical Analysis: Conduct further statistical investigations to uncover more intricate relationships between variables and gain deeper insights into the dataset.
* Performance Investigation: Analyze the reasons behind the current low model performance to identify specific areas for improvement.
